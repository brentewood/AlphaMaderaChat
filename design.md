AlphaMadera is about leveraing AI models to help people live a long and healthy life.  We are going to start with diet and nutrition. We believe, especially in the US, that people are not eating the right foods and are not getting the right nutrition.  We are going to use AI to help people eat healthier and hopefully live longer. We'll leverage the power of AI to help people make better choices about what they eat and help our customers construct a diet that is tailored to optimize their health.

Of course, we'll start with the basics.  We'll start with a simple chatbot that can answer questions about nutrition and diet.  We'll then move on to more complex models that can help people make better choices about what they eat.

Weight loss is a big problem in the US.  We believe that AI can help people lose weight by helping them make better choices about what they eat.  We'll leverage the power of AI to help people make better choices about what they eat and help the construct a diet that is tailored to optimize their health.

We dont know how quickly LLM other generative AI models will improve - so we'll start with the basics and then move on to more complex models and problems.

We will leverage existing consumer ecosystems like Apple Health and Google Fit to facilitate the collection of data. Our value will be in the analysis of the data and the recommendations we can make to the user. As an example, if one our customers has goal to lose weight but not lose muscle mass, we can recommend a diet that is low in calories but high in protein and healthy fats. We can calculate with acceptionable accuracy the amount of calories and macronutrients that they should consume and specific recipes that they should eat.
